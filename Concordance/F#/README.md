Concordance in F#
=================

In order to compile and run the F# version one has to install the .Net 4.5 or Mono 2.10.8 runtime 
and the F# 3.0 compiler and libraries. Assuming that a compatible runtime is installed, F# can be
compiled from its [sources](https://github.com/fsharp/fsharp).

To compile this version of Concordance, one can use the standard make tool or the F# compiler to
compile the sources found in **/src**. The executable will be created in **/target**.

In **/test**, there is an F# script which can be used for testing in the F# Interactive.
